# R Data Mining Projects
This is the code repository for [R Data Mining Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/r-data-mining-projects-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787283954), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The R language is a powerful open source functional programming language. At its core, R is a statistical programming language that provides impressive tools for data mining and analysis. It enables you to create high-level graphics and offers an interface to other languages. This means R is best suited to producing data and visual analytics through customization scripts and commands, instead of the typical statistical tools that provide tick boxes and drop-down menus for users.
This video course explores data mining techniques, showing you how to apply different mining concepts to various statistical and data applications in a wide range of fields. We will teach you about R and its application to data mining, and give you relevant and useful information you can use to develop and improve your applications. It will help you complete complex data mining cases and guide you through handling issues you might encounter during projects.
